# Privacy Policy For SaltBot V2 Revision 1

I don't need a huge list like other companies so here's what I collect in understandable and readable terms.

- Usernames and user-numbers
- What servers the bot is in
- Commands invoked by those users (Specific server usage is not tracked)
- Time and date of when command was issued
- What files are fetched by the bot
- Errors that occur during operation

This is what is collected by default however, if another bot maintainer forks this project then their policy may differ from this one
